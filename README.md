#  hello_os: Resonant Intelligence Playground

**An open-source framework for exploring the intersection of sound, field dynamics, AI, and human-machine resonance.**

---

## Overview

hello_os is a modular research environment that unites **electromagnetic resonance modeling**, **neurofeedback simulation**, **AI-driven rhythm analysis**, and **multi-dimensional learning environments** into one open-source ecosystem.  
It’s designed to experiment with how energy, information, and consciousness might self-organize through frequency, rhythm, and adaptive feedback.
