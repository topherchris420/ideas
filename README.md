## 🪶 Mission Statement

> **Building a foundation for resonant intelligence.**

**hello_os** is an open-source experiment exploring how frequency, feedback, and computation can model living systems.  


### 🌱 Core Principles
1. **Open Inquiry:** All findings, code, and data remain open for educational and research use.  
2. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Bridging physics, AI, music, and consciousness studies.  
3. **Responsible Exploration:** All experiments remain in simulation space, guided by safety, transparency, and reproducibility.  
4. **Community Evolution:** Each fork, remix, or improvement adds another layer to the living foundation of resonant intelligence.
